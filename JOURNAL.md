This is my second project for Highway, and as such it will be a lot smaller than my previous one. *yes, i REALLY want to go to Undercity.* Also, the format for both the `JOURNAL.md` file as well as the folder containing the CAD files will be similar or exactly the same.

For this project, my goal is to design a very simple solder fume extractor that meets the following criteria:
- Easy to build for beginners
- Affordable ($15-20 USD cost goal)
- Works well

I began with researching types of fans and which would be a good one for this application.
